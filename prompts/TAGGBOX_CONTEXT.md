# Taggbox social widget - project context

Data source: GET {API_BASE_URL}/v3/posts
API docs: https://github.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs
API spec: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt
(a local llms.txt copy is in this folder) - follow it exactly for endpoints,
field names and the response envelope ({ status, message, code, body }).

Two more files complete the brief - fetch them RAW when you can reach the
network, and say so in one line if you cannot:
- Build brief (what to build, wiring, what to hand over):
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/widget-build-brief.md
- Design spec (--tbx-* tokens, the shipped themes in themes-lite.json, card
  treatment, layouts, states):
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/widget-design-spec.md
  Without it, at least use the brand colours --tbx-purple #613983,
  --tbx-pink #cc3d6f, --tbx-pink-ink #a82b56, --tbx-pink-lite #eb5c99,
  --tbx-accent #ff492c on `:root`. One skin - no dark mode and no
  theme toggle.

Rules for all code in this project:

- Read the credential from the ACCESS_TOKEN env var (an account
  access token or a wt1_ wall token, both work) and the base URL from
  API_BASE_URL (default https://api.taggbox.com/api). Never
  hard-code either.
- All Taggbox API calls run server-side; the token must never reach the
  browser.
- The payload is inside the envelope: body.posts / body.paging. Check the
  HTTP status AND the envelope's `status` flag; on 422 log body.fields.
- Do not override the default sort (pinned first, then newest).
- Paginate with paging.next_cursor passed back as `after`; never construct a
  cursor by hand.
- Cache API responses for 5 minutes; serve the last good cache if a request
  fails, never render blank.
- Render content.text as text and escape all output to prevent XSS.
- Prefer media[].cdn_url for images.
- Render on the server. The posts are in the HTML before it leaves the
  server; nothing in the browser calls the API or any endpoint.
- Every build ships BOTH languages: a single self-contained index.php, and the
  Node.js set (server.js, package.json, cache/posts.json) - plus one README.md
  documenting both.
- Every build also ships a preview.html: the same page as a static file, with
  the sample posts baked into the HTML as finished markup. It calls nothing -
  no fetch, no API call, no token - so the design can be reviewed by
  double-clicking it, with nothing installed. Same CSS and markup as the two
  server versions, and a restyle applies to all three. Never call it
  index.html: it would be served instead of index.php.
- Do not stop to ask for the token or base URL before writing code. Build with
  the defaults above, then ask the user for both values at the end.
