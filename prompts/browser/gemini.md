# Gemini - build a Taggbox social widget

Use this when you are chatting with Gemini in the browser. It cannot touch
your computer, so the prompts below make it hand you complete files plus a
setup checklist. It asks you two things first - which theme, then which
language the server code should be in - and nothing else before the code.

## 1. Get the spec file

Download [llms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt) to your computer
(right-click the link, "Save link as...", keep the name `llms.txt`), or in a
terminal:

```bash
curl -sSLo llms.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt
```

## 2. Start the chat and attach the spec

1. Open https://gemini.google.com and start a **new chat**.
2. Click the **+** button in the message box, choose **Upload files**, and
   pick `llms.txt`.
3. Paste the prompt from step 3 and send.

Gemini follows instructions very literally. If you write "ask me for my
token before you start", it will stop, ask, and write a plan instead of code -
the code only arrives after you answer. The prompt below therefore names
the only two questions it may ask - theme, then language - and moves the
token to the end. Gemini also does not always open raw GitHub URLs, so
always attach the file. If it offers to open the result in **Canvas**, that is
fine - the file content is the same.

## 3. Paste this prompt

Five lines. Paste the block as your first message with
llms.txt attached (or its contents pasted underneath). The detailed rules live
in llms.txt; the AI reads them there.

```
Build me a social widget: one web page that shows the live posts from my Taggbox gallery.
Brief: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/widget-build-brief.md?v=2026-09-24c - fetch it RAW and the two specs it links (the API spec and the design spec); if you cannot fetch URLs, follow the attached llms.txt.
First show me the theme picker from the theme catalogue as an HTML artifact - the thumbnails page itself, not a list of names - and ask which theme I want; then ask exactly this - never shortened into an either/or between two languages: "Which language or framework do you want the server code in? Any one you name." One question per reply, and start building on my second answer. If I name PHP or Node.js, the files for every theme are already built and tested: fetch them RAW from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/templates/php/ or .../nodejs/ (index.php or server.js, README.md, .env.example) plus .../guides/templates/themes/<slug>.css, <slug>.template.html, <slug>.json for my theme, and hand them over unchanged - do not rewrite them. Any other language: build only in that language: the runnable server file(s) and their README.md in the same reply, plus a preview.html - the same page as a static file with the sample posts baked into the HTML, calling nothing, so I can double-click it and see the design before I have a token. Token comes from the ACCESS_TOKEN env var - write the code first, then ask me for it at the end.
Give me the complete code first, then tell me how to run it as if I've never used a terminal.
You can't access my computer, so output every file complete and ready to save, starting each with "### FILE: <name>", then a setup checklist.
```

## 4. Save the files it gives you

For every `### FILE:` block: click the copy button on the code block, open a
plain-text editor (macOS: TextEdit with Format > Make Plain Text; Windows:
Notepad; or VS Code), paste, and save with the exact filename shown into a
new folder called `my-social-widget`. Do not let the editor add `.txt`.

### Run it

The `README.md` the AI hands over **together with the server code** has the
exact check and run commands for the language you picked. The common ones:

| Language | Check it is installed | Run it (in `my-social-widget`) | Open |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---- |
| Python   | `python3 --version` (Windows: `py --version`) | `python3 app.py` | the URL it prints |
| Node.js  | `node -v` (v18 or higher) | `node server.js` | the URL it prints |
| PHP      | `php -v` (8.x) | `php -S localhost:8080` | http://localhost:8080 |
| Go       | `go version` | `go run main.go` | the URL it prints |

Any other language or a framework you named: the README gives its own check,
install (only if a framework needs one) and run command.

Put your token in a `.env` file beside the server file - the code reads it on
its own:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN=wt1_your_token_here
API_BASE_URL=https://api.taggbox.com/api
```

Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

Verify the API side independently of the page:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer wt1_your_token_here" "https://api.taggbox.com/api/v3/posts?limit=1"
```

You should see `"status":true` and one post inside `body.posts`. A 401 means
the token is wrong or the API is disabled for the account; the message says
which.

## If it goes wrong

- **The AI asked anything besides the theme and the language before writing
  code** - reply: "Build it now with the defaults in the prompt, and ask me
  for the credentials at the end."
- **It showed a list of theme names instead of the pictures** - reply: "Show
  me the theme picker page itself, rendered, as the theme catalogue says."
- **It wrote the server code in a different language than you asked** - reply:
  "Rewrite the server code in <your language>, with its README."
- **`Taggbox API error: 401`** - token missing or wrong in the environment
  variable, or the API is switched off for the account.
- **`422 Validation Failed`** - a query parameter is wrong; the response's
  `body.fields` names it. Paste it back to the AI.
- **Blank widget, no error** - the account has no approved posts, or the wall
  token points at a widget with none. Test with the curl command above.
- **Fields look wrong** (`undefined`, empty author) - the AI guessed field
  names; make sure llms.txt was attached or is in the folder, and paste the
  Post object section from it.
