# ChatGPT - build a Taggbox social widget

Use this when you are chatting with ChatGPT in the browser. It cannot touch
your computer, so the prompts below make it hand you complete files (or a
download link) plus a setup checklist. It walks through short steps - theme,
then the preview, an optional customise, then PHP / Node.js / React /
Simple HTML / Other - and nothing else before the code. The first four
stacks are already built and tested, so those arrive as a ready zip in
seconds; naming anything else ports that same code into your stack instead.

## 1. Get the spec file

Download [llms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt) to your computer
(right-click the link, "Save link as...", keep the name `llms.txt`), or in a
terminal:

```bash
curl -sSLo llms.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt
```

## 2. Start the chat and attach the spec

1. Open https://chatgpt.com and start a **new chat**.
2. Click the **+** (paperclip) button next to the message box, choose
   **Upload from computer**, and pick `llms.txt`.
3. Paste the prompt from step 3 and send.

ChatGPT can sometimes fetch URLs itself, but attaching the file is more
reliable than hoping it browses. If your plan has no file upload, paste the
whole llms.txt at the bottom of the prompt instead. Use the **Copy code**
button on each code block - never retype a file.

## 3. Paste this prompt

Four lines. Paste the block below as your first message, in a brand-new
chat (a continued one may reuse an old, stale fetch instead of reading the
files fresh). It is one link, steps.md - the theme picker, the language
question, then the build, fetched one step at a time so every reply stays
quick and the theme-picker render is never spelled out here.

```
Build me a social widget from my Taggbox gallery.
Fetch this RAW and follow it exactly - it lists every step and when
to stop and wait for my answer. Every step that is a page (theme
picker, preview) goes in Canvas, rendered as HTML - never described.
Start with step 1 now:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/steps.md
If a link will not open, say so in one line and stop.
```

## 4. Save the files it gives you

**PHP / Node.js / React / Simple HTML:** click the download link, unzip it
into a folder called `my-social-widget`, then put the `.env` (and
`custom.css`, if you asked for a change) it gave you inside that same
unzipped folder.

**Any other stack:** for every `### FILE:` block, click the copy button on
the code block, open a plain-text editor (macOS: TextEdit with Format >
Make Plain Text; Windows: Notepad; or VS Code), paste, and save with the
exact filename shown into `my-social-widget`. Do not let the editor add
`.txt`.

### Run it

The `README.md` inside the folder has the exact check and run commands.
The four built-in stacks:

| Stack | Check it is installed | Run it (in `my-social-widget`) | Open |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---- |
| PHP / Simple HTML | `php -v` (8.x) | `php -S localhost:8080` | http://localhost:8080 |
| Node.js | `node -v` (v18 or higher) | `npm install`, then `npm start` | http://localhost:3000 |
| React | `node -v` (v18 or higher) | `npm install`, then `npm run dev` | http://localhost:5173 |

Any other stack you named: the README gives its own check, install (only if
the framework needs one) and run command.

Put your token in a `.env` file beside the server file - the code reads it on
its own:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN=wt1_your_token_here
API_BASE_URL=https://api.taggbox.com/api
```

Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

Verify the API side independently of the page:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer wt1_your_token_here" "https://api.taggbox.com/api/v3/posts?limit=1"
```

You should see `"status":true` and one post inside `body.posts`. A 401 means
the token is wrong or the API is disabled for the account; the message says
which.

## If it goes wrong

- **The AI asked anything besides theme, customise-or-not and stack before
  writing code** - reply: "Build it now with the defaults in the prompt, and
  ask me for the credentials at the end."
- **It showed a list of theme names instead of the pictures** - reply: "Show
  me the theme picker page itself, rendered - `guides/themes/thumbnails.html`,
  as steps.md says - never a list."
- **It wrote the server code in a different stack than you asked** - reply:
  "Rewrite it for <your stack>, with its README."
- **`Taggbox API error: 401`** - token missing or wrong in the environment
  variable, or the API is switched off for the account.
- **`422 Validation Failed`** - a query parameter is wrong; the response's
  `body.fields` names it. Paste it back to the AI.
- **Blank widget, no error** - the account has no approved posts, or the wall
  token points at a widget with none. Test with the curl command above.
- **Fields look wrong** (`undefined`, empty author) - the AI guessed field
  names; make sure llms.txt was attached or is in the folder, and paste the
  Post object section from it.
