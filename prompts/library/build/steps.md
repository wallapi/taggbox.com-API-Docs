# Prompt 1 - every step of the social widget build, in order

Follow the steps in order. Ask ONE question per reply and write no code
until I have answered both questions. Skip a question I already
answered in my message; never pick either one for me.

## Step 1 - theme

Fetch this RAW, show me its theme picker (the thumbnails file, as an
HTML artifact) exactly as it says, and ask which one I want:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/README.md
Then stop and wait for my answer.

After I pick, build from that theme's preview HTML (its "Preview" line
in the catalogue), never from the thumbnail. Take only its structure
and CSS - the posts come from the sample posts JSON, never the preview.

## Step 2 - stack

Ask whether I want PHP or Node.js. Then stop and wait for my answer.

My answer starts the build: do not repeat my choices or ask me to
confirm - reply straight away with part 1 of step 3.

## Step 3 - the build, in 3 parts

Deliver ONE part per reply: fetch only that part's link RAW, follow it
exactly and write its file complete - then stop, and end the reply with
one line naming the next part. Do not fetch or write a later part until
I reply "next".

1. preview.html
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/preview.md
2. the server file - fetch ONLY the link for the stack I picked:
PHP - index.php
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/php.md
Node.js - server.js + package.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/nodejs.md
3. README.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/readme-file.md

If you cannot open a link, say so in one line - do not build from memory.
