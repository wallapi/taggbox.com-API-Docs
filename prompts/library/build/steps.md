# Prompt 1 - every step of the social widget build, in order

Follow the steps in order. Ask ONE question per reply and write no code
until I have answered both questions. Skip a question I already
answered in my message; never pick either one for me.

## Step 1 - theme

Fetch this RAW and show me its theme picker the way it says - the
thumbnails page itself, rendered (an HTML artifact, or the page opened
in my browser), never a list of theme names and never a table of your
own - and ask which one I want. Only if the page cannot be shown, use the
catalogue's thumbnail table as it is: two columns, the numbered theme name
and the thumbnail as a picture, nothing else:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/README.md
Then stop and wait for my answer.

After I pick, fetch that theme's preview file RAW (its "Preview" line
in the catalogue) - it is the template, never the thumbnail. Its
<style>, then its build note, <template id="tbx-card-template"> and
arrow script come first, at the top of <body>; the sample cards come
last. Copy the whole file as it is except those sample cards, and only
inject the posts: one card per post from its template, between its
tbx:cards marks, as the catalogue's "Filling the card" says. The posts
come from the sample posts JSON (or the live API), never from the
preview's sample cards.

## Step 2 - language

Ask which language I want the server code in - any server-side
language works (PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, C#, ...) or a
framework (Laravel, Express, Flask, Django, ...). Then stop and wait
for my answer, and build in exactly the language I name.

These guides cover every language: the rules are the same whatever it
is, and server.md says how to write it in any of them. Never tell me
the guide only supports some languages, never offer me a shorter list
to choose from, and never switch to a language I did not name. If
another page shows code in PHP or Node.js, that is an example, not a
limit.

My answer starts the build: do not repeat my choices or ask me to
confirm - reply straight away with part 1 of step 3.

## Step 3 - the build, in 2 parts

Deliver ONE part per reply: fetch only that part's link RAW, follow it
exactly and write its files complete - then stop, and end the reply
with one line naming the next part. Do not fetch or write a later part
until I reply "next".

1. preview.html
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/preview.md
2. the runnable server files in my language (or framework), with their README.md in the same reply
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/prompts/library/build/server.md

If you cannot open a link, say so in one line - do not build from memory.
