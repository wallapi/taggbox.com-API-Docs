# Prompt A, part 3 of 4 - server.js + package.json

Fetch all three RAW and follow them exactly - the brief is what to
build, llms.txt carries the exact data field names (unguessable, and
the brief does not repeat them), the design spec the looks:

Already fetched one of these for an earlier part? Do not fetch it again.

Deliver the Node.js set: server.js and package.json - API call, cache
(brief section 3), HTML and CSS inside server.js, no separate
stylesheet. Same CSS and markup as preview.html and index.php from
parts 1-2. Read the base URL and token from the API_BASE_URL and
ACCESS_TOKEN settings - never hard-code them.
