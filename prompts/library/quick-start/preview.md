# Prompt A, part 1 of 3 - preview.html

Fetch all three RAW and follow them exactly - the brief is what to
build, llms.txt carries the exact data field names (unguessable, and
the brief does not repeat them), the design spec the looks:

Already fetched one of these for an earlier part? Do not fetch it again.

Deliver preview.html: the same page as a static file with the brief's
sample posts baked into the HTML, calling nothing, so I can
double-click it and see the design before I have a token. Skin it
with the theme I picked from the theme catalogue (design spec section
2) and name it in one line. The CSS lives inside it - no separate
stylesheet - and the server file for my stack reuses this markup and
CSS. Name it preview.html, not index.html.
