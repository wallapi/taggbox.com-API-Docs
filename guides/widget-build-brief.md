# Build brief — one link an AI can follow

The complete brief for building a Taggbox social widget, in one fetchable file,
so a prompt can stay four lines. It binds together the two specs and adds the
few things neither of them says:

| Read | For |
| ---- | --- |
| [llms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt) | the API: endpoints, envelope, field names, and the numbered **Integration rules** for generated code |
| [widget-design-spec.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/widget-design-spec.md) | the looks: `--tbx-*` tokens, how a theme maps onto them, card treatment, REEL and MOSAIC layouts, states |
| [themes/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/README.md) | the theme catalogue: 19 themes, each with a thumbnail, its layout and its values — the user picks one |
| this file | the delivery contract: what to hand over and how it is wired |

**Agents: fetch them RAW.** A summarising fetch drops the field names,
which are the one thing that cannot be guessed.

Nothing here overrides llms.txt. Where this file is silent, its Integration
rules decide.

## 0. Ask first — theme, then stack, then confirm

Two choices change what gets built, so they are asked **before any code**, one
question per reply:

1. **Theme.** Fetch the [theme catalogue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/README.md) raw,
   show its list as it is — number, name, what it looks like, thumbnail image —
   and ask which one they want. Stop there.
2. **Stack.** Once they pick, ask: **PHP or Node.js?** Stop there.
3. **Confirm.** Repeat both choices back in one line — e.g. "Theme 3, Modern
   Card, in PHP — shall I build it?" — and wait for a yes. Change whatever they
   correct.

Skip a question the prompt already answers. Never pick either one for them.
Only after the yes does the build start — and then only the picked stack's
parts are fetched and written.

## 1. What to build

**It is a Social Widget.** Use that name in the page title, the header, the
README and the code comments — never "social wall".

**Server-rendered, always.** The page arrives with the posts already in the
HTML. Nothing in the browser calls anything — not the Taggbox API, and not an
endpoint of their own:

```
     [ browser ]        complete HTML, posts already in it, no fetch
          ▲
          │  a whole page
          │
   [ their server ]     holds ACCESS_TOKEN, caches 5 min, renders the HTML
          │
          ▼
   GET {API_BASE_URL}/v3/posts   Authorization: Bearer …
```

No mount point, no widget script, no same-origin JSON endpoint, no `data-`
attributes. One request from the browser gets a finished page.

**Deliver the stack they picked** (§0) — PHP or Node.js — plus
`preview.html`. Never write the other stack unless they ask for both.

**Node.js** — when they picked Node.js

| File | Holds |
| ---- | ----- |
| `server.js` | everything: the API call, the cache, the HTML and the CSS |
| `package.json` | Express, and a `start` script |
| `cache/posts.json` | the cache file — ship it empty or gitignored, and make the code create it if it is missing |
| `README.md` | the documentation for the picked stack (§6) |

**PHP** — when they picked PHP

| File | Holds |
| ---- | ----- |
| `index.php` | **one file, everything in it** — the API call, the cache, the HTML and the CSS. Nothing to install, nothing to require |

The PHP file writes its cache beside itself (`cache/posts.json`) and creates
the directory if it is missing.

**And one static file, whichever stack they picked:**

| File | Holds |
| ---- | ----- |
| `preview.html` | the same page with the §4 sample posts already expanded into markup — the same CSS, the same layout, no server, no build step, no token, and no call of any kind. It opens from a double-click |

`preview.html` is how the design gets reviewed before a token exists, on a
machine with neither PHP nor Node installed, and inside a chat that can run
neither. It must call **nothing**: no `fetch`, no API request, not even a
same-origin one — the posts are in the file already. It carries no JavaScript at all, and it carries the §4 "preview data" note.

Name it `preview.html`, **never `index.html`**: an `index.html` sitting beside
`index.php` is served *instead of it* by most Apache and nginx configurations,
so the first upload would quietly swap the live page for the sample one.

`preview.html` and the server file render the same layout from the same design
tokens, so they look identical in a browser and any restyle has to land in
both at once. The layout is the one the picked theme shows.

## 2. Configuration — the token is asked at the end, never hard-coded

| Value | Environment variable | Where the user gets it |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Token | `ACCESS_TOKEN` | their dashboard — the four steps below; an account key, or a `wt1_…` wall token |
| API base URL | `API_BASE_URL` (strip a trailing slash) | always `https://api.taggbox.com/api` — a constant; the variable exists only so another host can be pointed at |

Only the token is theirs to fetch: the base URL is a constant, so default to
it rather than asking as though they had to look it up.

When you ask for the token at the end, give the steps, not a vague "paste your
token":

1. Log in to your Taggbox dashboard.
2. Open the gallery you want the posts from, or create one.
3. On that gallery's card, click the **⋮** (three dots) menu.
4. Click **Access Token** and copy the value.

If "Access Token" is not in that menu, say so plainly and stop there — do not
speculate about why, and do not tell them to buy or upgrade anything. Theme
and stack are the only questions asked up front (§0). The token is not one of
them: the code reads it from the environment, so it is complete without it —
ask for it at the end of the README reply and offer to write it into a `.env`.
Never hard-code either value. Ship an example
env file with empty values, never a real token. The token is read on the
server and printed nowhere: it must not appear in the rendered HTML, in a
comment, or in a data attribute.

## 3. Data and caching

Follow llms.txt rules 5–12. In short: one call to
`GET {API_BASE_URL}/v3/posts?limit=24`, default sort kept (pinned first,
then newest), payload at `body.posts` / `body.paging`, check the HTTP status
**and** the envelope `status` flag, a 5-minute cache on disk, the last-good
copy served on failure, every printed value escaped.

- Cache to a JSON file, read it when it is younger than 5 minutes, otherwise
  refresh. PHP and Node.js do this the same way, so the README describes it the
  same whichever stack was picked.
- One cache at a 5-minute TTL ≈ **288 API calls a day**, whatever the traffic.
  Say in one line what the TTL you implemented will cost them.
- If they run several PHP workers or Node instances, each keeps its own file
  cache unless they point it at shared storage — say so rather than silently
  multiplying their daily count.
- More than one page of posts: `paging.next_cursor` goes back as `after` on a
  normal server-side request — a link or a form, never a browser fetch. Keep
  the same `sort` across pages or the cursor 422s.

## 4. States

Design spec §6: an empty result and a failed request both render as real
markup inside the page — never a blank body and never a stack trace. A stale
cached copy beats an error. Ship the inline `SAMPLE_POSTS` preview fallback so
the design can still be reviewed before a token exists (llms.txt rule 12).

The same posts are what `preview.html` renders. Take them from
[sample-posts-social.json](sample-posts-social.json) and
[sample-posts-reviews.json](sample-posts-reviews.json) in this folder, fetched
raw — 8–12 of each is plenty — and copy every media URL character for character:
never retype, shorten or invent one. If you cannot reach them, write that many
in the same shape with no media rather than a made-up URL, and include a review
post carrying a `rating`, or the widget never shows its star rating. Video posts
and the media placeholder follow the design spec §3. The whole build is skinned from the theme picked in §0,
from the [theme catalogue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/README.md) — copy the picked
theme's preview HTML (its CSS and card markup, the real posts in place of the
samples, no `<script>`) for the layout, colours, font and spacing; the
thumbnail is only for the question. How those values map onto the design tokens is in the design spec,
under **Themes** in section 2. One theme is the entire skin: no light/dark
mode, no toggle.

## 5. Styling

The CSS lives inside the deliverable — inside `server.js` for Node, inside
`index.php` for PHP, inside `preview.html` for the static one — not in a
separate stylesheet. The same CSS in `preview.html` and the server file, so
the preview is worth trusting. The page is theirs, so it
may own `:root` and `<body>` freely. Tokens, layouts, themes and contrast
rules: the design spec.

## 6. Hand-off

Deliverable first, commentary last — no opening plan of what you are about to
build.

1. **Every file, complete, with its exact path** — `preview.html` and the
   picked stack's files (the PHP file, or the Node.js set) — one part per
   reply when the prompt splits the build into parts.
2. **`README.md`**, which is a deliverable and not a summary. It covers the
   picked stack only and contains: what this is and which theme it wears; the
   file list; how to set
   `API_BASE_URL` and `ACCESS_TOKEN`; how to run it locally (written for
   someone who has never used a terminal) and the URL to open; that
   `preview.html` needs none of that — it is opened by double-clicking it, and
   it is a design preview, not the page to deploy; how the cache
   works and how to change the TTL; how to change the layout and the colours;
   one `curl` that checks the Taggbox API directly with what a good response
   looks like; and a short "if it goes wrong" list — 401, empty page, stale
   posts.
3. Ask for the token, offering to write it into `.env`.
4. Any assumptions you made, listed at the end — theme and stack are the only
   things asked at the start.
5. **No tests.** Do not write or run tests, audits or checks — no
   accessibility or contrast scripts, no auth or 401 flow tests, no curl
   calls, no test files. The `curl` in the README is for the user to run.

If you cannot write files (a browser chat), output every file complete with its
filename, then that same README.

## 7. Things this API does not have — do not add them

Already in llms.txt, and the four an assistant invents anyway:

- no `fields` parameter — every response carries the full post object;
- `after` is not a post id — it is the opaque `paging.next_cursor`, passed back
  verbatim;
- no `networks` and no `wall_id` parameter — filter by network with `feed_ids`;
- no write endpoints, no RSS feed, no `include_source` (each post already
  carries a `network` object). Moderation happens in the dashboard.
