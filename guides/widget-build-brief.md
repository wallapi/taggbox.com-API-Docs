# Build brief — one link an AI can follow

The complete brief for building a Taggbox social widget, in one fetchable file,
so a prompt can stay four lines. It binds together the two specs and adds the
few things neither of them says:

| Read | For |
| ---- | --- |
| [llms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/llms.txt) | the API: endpoints, envelope, field names, and the numbered **Integration rules** for generated code |
| [widget-design-spec.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/widget-design-spec.md) | the looks: `--tbx-*` tokens, the shipped themes in themes-lite.json, card treatment, REEL and MOSAIC layouts, states |
| this file | the delivery contract: what to hand over and how it is wired |

**Agents: fetch all three RAW.** A summarising fetch drops the field names,
which are the one thing that cannot be guessed.

Nothing here overrides llms.txt. Where this file is silent, its Integration
rules decide.

## 1. What to build

**It is a Social Widget.** Use that name in the page title, the header, the
README and the code comments — never "social wall".

**Server-rendered, always.** The page arrives with the posts already in the
HTML. Nothing in the browser calls anything — not the Taggbox API, and not an
endpoint of their own:

```
     [ browser ]        complete HTML, posts already in it, no fetch
          ▲
          │  a whole page
          │
   [ their server ]     holds ACCESS_TOKEN, caches 5 min, renders the HTML
          │
          ▼
   GET {API_BASE_URL}/v3/posts   Authorization: Bearer …
```

No mount point, no widget script, no same-origin JSON endpoint, no `data-`
attributes. One request from the browser gets a finished page.

**Deliver BOTH languages, every time.** Not one or the other, and never a
choice put back to the user:

**Node.js**

| File | Holds |
| ---- | ----- |
| `server.js` | everything: the API call, the cache, the HTML and the CSS |
| `package.json` | Express, and a `start` script |
| `cache/posts.json` | the cache file — ship it empty or gitignored, and make the code create it if it is missing |
| `README.md` | the documentation, covering **both** languages (§6) |

**PHP**

| File | Holds |
| ---- | ----- |
| `index.php` | **one file, everything in it** — the API call, the cache, the HTML and the CSS. Nothing to install, nothing to require |

The PHP file writes its cache beside itself (`cache/posts.json`) and creates
the directory if it is missing.

**And one static file both of them share:**

| File | Holds |
| ---- | ----- |
| `preview.html` | the same page with the §4 sample posts already expanded into markup — the same CSS, the same layout, no server, no build step, no token, and no call of any kind. It opens from a double-click |

`preview.html` is how the design gets reviewed before a token exists, on a
machine with neither PHP nor Node installed, and inside a chat that can run
neither. It must call **nothing**: no `fetch`, no API request, not even a
same-origin one — the posts are in the file already. A theme toggle is the only
JavaScript it may carry, and it carries the §4 "preview data" note.

Name it `preview.html`, **never `index.html`**: an `index.html` sitting beside
`index.php` is served *instead of it* by most Apache and nginx configurations,
so the first upload would quietly swap the live page for the sample one.

All three render the same layout from the same design tokens, so the outputs
look identical in a browser and any restyle has to land in all three at once.

## 2. Configuration — ask at the end, never hard-code

| Value | Environment variable | Where the user gets it |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Token | `ACCESS_TOKEN` | their dashboard — the four steps below; an account key, or a `wt1_…` wall token |
| API base URL | `API_BASE_URL` (strip a trailing slash) | always `https://api.taggbox.com/api` — a constant; the variable exists only so another host can be pointed at |

Only the token is theirs to fetch: the base URL is a constant, so default to
it rather than asking as though they had to look it up.

When you ask for the token at the end, give the steps, not a vague "paste your
token":

1. Log in to your Taggbox dashboard.
2. Open the gallery you want the posts from, or create one.
3. On that gallery's card, click the **⋮** (three dots) menu.
4. Click **Access Token** and copy the value.

If "Access Token" is not in that menu, say so plainly and stop there — do not
speculate about why, and do not tell them to buy or upgrade anything. Write the code first — it reads them
from the environment, so it is complete without them — then ask for both at
the end of that same reply and offer to write them into a `.env`. Never open
with the question and wait, and never hard-code either value. Ship an example
env file with empty values, never a real token. The token is read on the
server and printed nowhere: it must not appear in the rendered HTML, in a
comment, or in a data attribute.

## 3. Data and caching

Follow llms.txt rules 5–12. In short: one call to
`GET {API_BASE_URL}/v3/posts?limit=24`, default sort kept (pinned first,
then newest), payload at `body.posts` / `body.paging`, check the HTTP status
**and** the envelope `status` flag, a 5-minute cache on disk, the last-good
copy served on failure, every printed value escaped.

- Cache to a JSON file, read it when it is younger than 5 minutes, otherwise
  refresh. Both languages do this the same way, so the README can describe it
  once.
- One cache at a 5-minute TTL ≈ **288 API calls a day**, whatever the traffic.
  Say in one line what the TTL you implemented will cost them.
- If they run several PHP workers or Node instances, each keeps its own file
  cache unless they point it at shared storage — say so rather than silently
  multiplying their daily count.
- More than one page of posts: `paging.next_cursor` goes back as `after` on a
  normal server-side request — a link or a form, never a browser fetch. Keep
  the same `sort` across pages or the cursor 422s.

## 4. States

Design spec §6: an empty result and a failed request both render as real
markup inside the page — never a blank body and never a stack trace. A stale
cached copy beats an error. Ship the inline `SAMPLE_POSTS` preview fallback so
the design can still be reviewed before a token exists (llms.txt rule 12).

The same posts are what `preview.html` renders. Take them from
[sample-posts-social.json](sample-posts-social.json) and
[sample-posts-reviews.json](sample-posts-reviews.json) in this folder, fetched
raw — 8–12 of each is plenty. If you cannot reach them, invent that many in the
same shape, and include both a review post carrying a `rating` and a text-only
post whose `media` array is empty, or the widget never shows its star rating and
its tinted text tiles. The whole build is skinned from `themes-lite.json`. That catalogue and the way its
fields map onto the design tokens are documented in the design spec, under
**Themes** in section 2 — read it there rather than guessing at the field
names. One theme is the entire skin: no light/dark mode, no toggle.

## 5. Styling

The CSS lives inside the deliverable — inside `server.js` for Node, inside
`index.php` for PHP, inside `preview.html` for the static one — not in a
separate stylesheet. The same CSS in all three, so the preview is worth
trusting. The page is theirs, so it
may own `:root` and `<body>` freely. Tokens, layouts, themes and contrast
rules: the design spec.

## 6. Hand-off

Deliverable first, commentary last — no opening plan of what you are about to
build.

1. **Every file, complete, with its exact path** — the Node.js set, the PHP
   file and `preview.html`, all in the same reply. No "the PHP version is
   similar".
2. **`README.md`**, which is a deliverable and not a summary. It covers both
   languages and contains: what this is; the file list for each; how to set
   `API_BASE_URL` and `ACCESS_TOKEN`; how to run each one locally (written for
   someone who has never used a terminal) and the URL to open; that
   `preview.html` needs none of that — it is opened by double-clicking it, and
   it is a design preview, not the page to deploy; how the cache
   works and how to change the TTL; how to change the layout and the colours;
   one `curl` that checks the Taggbox API directly with what a good response
   looks like; and a short "if it goes wrong" list — 401, empty page, stale
   posts.
3. Ask for the base URL and the token, offering to write them into `.env`.
4. Any assumptions you made, listed at the end — not asked at the start.

If you cannot write files (a browser chat), output every file complete with its
filename, then that same README.

## 7. Things this API does not have — do not add them

Already in llms.txt, and the four an assistant invents anyway:

- no `fields` parameter — every response carries the full post object;
- `after` is not a post id — it is the opaque `paging.next_cursor`, passed back
  verbatim;
- no `networks` and no `wall_id` parameter — filter by network with `feed_ids`;
- no write endpoints, no RSS feed, no `include_source` (each post already
  carries a `network` object). Moderation happens in the dashboard.
