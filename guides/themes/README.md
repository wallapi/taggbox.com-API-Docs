# Widget themes — pick one, build from its preview

The 17 widget themes a Taggbox Social Widget build can wear: 14 for social
posts, 3 for reviews. Each one has a thumbnail of the real widget (to pick
from), a finished HTML preview of it (to build from), a line on its layout
and the values its colours, font and spacing come from.

Fetch this file RAW. Thumbnails are PNGs beside it, and the previews are HTML
files in the `previews` folder next to this one:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/<file>.png
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/previews/<theme>.html
```

The thumbnail is for the question only. Once a theme is picked, the build
comes from its preview HTML, never from the thumbnail.

## Agents: ask first — show the picture, never a list

Before writing any code, show the user **the theme picker page itself,
rendered** — the thumbnails, not a list of names. The picker is one small
page with every theme's name under its thumbnail, the images embedded as
base64 so it renders anywhere:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/themes/thumbnails.html?v=2026-09-25c
```

Show it the first way your tool allows:

1. **You can make an HTML artifact** (claude.ai, Claude Code, ChatGPT
   canvas, Gemini canvas): fetch it RAW and show it as an HTML artifact,
   exactly as it is. The file is about 45 KB, nearly all of it base64 WebP
   thumbnails — artifacts block outside image links, so the base64 is what
   makes it render. The artifact's code is the whole file, every base64
   string complete: never shorten or re-encode an image, never swap one for
   a link or a placeholder, never turn the page into markdown or a table.
   Before you decide this needs an external image load, look at what you
   actually fetched: every `<img>` tag in this file is
   `src="data:image/webp;base64,..."`, never `src="https://..."` or any
   other URL — grep the content you fetched for `src="http` and you will
   find zero matches. The file living at a GitHub URL does not make the
   pictures inside it remote; they are bytes already in your hands. So
   "hosted on GitHub", "external images" and "platform restrictions on
   loading remote images" are never true reasons to fall back to a chat
   list for this specific file — if that is what you are about to write,
   you have not looked at the `src=` attributes you just fetched.
   Before you show the artifact, compare it against these five checks -
   this exact file has none of the things on the left, so any one of
   them means you wrote your own page instead of copying this one:
   a "SOCIAL THEMES" / "REVIEW THEMES" section heading (there is no
   heading in this file, only one flat grid); a sentence describing the
   layout under a theme's name (this file's only text per theme is its
   name, in the `<figcaption>` - no "grid of review cards", no "one big
   photo at a time"); a card with no picture or a grey/placeholder box
   (this file has zero cards without a picture); an `<img src=` that is
   a URL ending in `.png` such as `bigThumb5.png` or
   `guides/themes/bigThumb5.png` (this file never links a `.png` - every
   picture is `data:image/webp;base64,...` already inlined; a `bigThumb*`
   link means you pulled it from a per-theme section under
   [The themes](#the-themes) below, which is for the build only and
   explicitly never for this question - even where it looks like a
   "picker" reference); or more than 17 cards. Each one means you
   summarised or linked from the catalogue's per-theme sections into a
   new design instead of fetching and using this file - go back and use
   the fetched HTML unchanged.
2. **You work in the user's folder** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot,
   Gemini CLI, Windsurf): download it as `theme-picker.html` without
   retyping it (`curl -sSLo theme-picker.html <url>`), then open it in their
   browser — `open theme-picker.html` on macOS, `start theme-picker.html` on
   Windows, `xdg-open theme-picker.html` on Linux. If you cannot run
   commands, tell them to double-click it. Say it can be deleted once they
   have picked.
3. **Neither:** say in one line that you cannot show the picker here, and
   ask which theme they want by name. Never show a table instead.

Copy the file character for character, the base64 included: never retype,
shorten, resize or redraw it, and add nothing to it.

**Never show a table or a list.** The picker page is the whole answer to the
theme question — no table of any kind (no "For", "Look", "What it looks like"
or thumbnail-link columns), and never the theme names alone. This also
covers a numbered chat list with one line per theme and the word
"thumbnail" written where an image should be — that is still a list, not
the picker, even with a note explaining why you skipped the artifact. There
are exactly 17 themes (14 social, 3 review); if a count or a name does not
match one of the 17 below, you invented it and must not show it. The file exists at the link
above; if a fetch of it fails, say the fetch failed — never that there is no
picker file. The per-theme sections under [The themes](#the-themes) are for
the build, not for the user — never summarise them in the question.

**Check your own copy before sending it.** An artifact can silently drop or
blur a thumbnail while still looking "done" — if any `<img>` you wrote is not
the exact base64 string from the fetched file, character for character, you
have corrupted it: redo the copy, do not send a partial one.

Then ask which theme they want; take its name or its number. If they already named a theme,
skip the question. Never pick one for them at random.

Your whole reply to the theme question is: the picker (or the note that you
could not show it), then one line — "Which theme do you want? Reply with its
name or number."

## How a theme becomes the build

**The picked theme's preview file is the template.** Fetch it RAW —
`guides/previews/<theme>.html`, the *Preview* line under the theme below —
before writing any code. It is the finished widget: the design is already
done, and the build only puts the posts into it. Never redraw it from the
thumbnail, the *Look* line or taste. If you cannot fetch it, say so in one
line — do not rebuild it from memory.

Read it in this order — the file is laid out so the part the build needs
comes first, even if a long fetch gets cut off: the `<style>` block in the
head, then at the top of `<body>` the `<!-- tbx:template … -->` note, the
card `<template>` and (slider themes) the arrow `<script>`, then the
`<section>`. The sample cards come last, between the `tbx:cards` marks, and
carry large base64 images: they only show the look — never copy them, never
retype their images.

1. **Copy the whole file as it is** — the `<style>` block (every `:root`
   value, rule and class), the `<section>` and everything inside it except
   the sample cards, the header, the arrow `<script>`. That copy is
   `preview.html`, and the same page is what the server code renders.
2. **Inject the posts.** Between `<!-- tbx:cards -->` and
   `<!-- /tbx:cards -->` sit the sample cards. Replace them with one card per
   post: the theme's own card from the `<template id="tbx-card-template">`
   at the top of the body, every `{{slot}}` filled as the table below says.
   `preview.html` fills it from the sample posts JSON; the server code fills
   it from `body.posts`, in a loop, at request time — same template, same
   output.
3. **Delete the build notes**: the `<!-- tbx:template … -->` comment, the
   `<template>` element and the two `tbx:cards` marks.
4. **Keep the `<script>`** if the theme has one — it is the slider arrows,
   copied as it is (see *Sliders* below).

Nothing else changes: no class renamed, no part moved or dropped, no CSS
added. The only text a build may set is the `.tbx-header` line (the user's own
title, or keep it), the `<p class="tbx-note">` "preview data" line the build
brief asks for, and `<p class="tbx-empty">` in place of the cards when there
are no posts — all three already styled by the file. The preview file's
sample posts, names, avatars and links are placeholders — none of them goes
into the build; the posts come only from the sample posts JSON or the API.

## Filling the card

Every value is HTML-escaped before it goes in. Absent values are `null` —
never print "null".

| Slot | From the post |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `{{permalink}}` | `source.permalink`, only if it starts `http://` or `https://`. None: the card is `<div class="tbx-card">…</div>` instead of the `<a>`, same classes |
| `{{network_name}}` | `network.name` |
| `{{network_slug}}` | `network.slug` |
| `{{network_mark}}` | by slug: instagram `IG`, facebook `f`, twitter / x `X`, linkedin `in`, pinterest `P`, google `G`, yelp `y`, tripadvisor `T`, trustpilot `★`, youtube `▶`, tiktok `♪`; any other: the first letter of `network.name` |
| `{{media}}` | the FIRST `media[]` entry of type `"image"`: `<img src="{cdn_url}" alt="" loading="lazy">`. A post with a `"video"` entry: `<video controls muted playsinline preload="none" poster="{first image cdn_url}"><source src="{video cdn_url}"></video>` (no poster attribute when it has no image). The `src` is `cdn_url` copied character for character — `http(s)`, or the `data:image/…` URI the sample posts carry |
| `{{media_width}}` `{{media_height}}` | that media entry's `width` and `height`. Either one null: drop the whole `style` attribute |
| `{{avatar}}` | `author.avatar_url` set: `<img class="tbx-avatar" src="{avatar_url}" alt="" loading="lazy" data-initial="{initial}">`; null: `<span class="tbx-avatar">{initial}</span>`. The initial is the first letter of `{{author}}`, upper-cased |
| `{{author}}` | `author.name`, else `author.handle` |
| `{{created_at}}` | `created_at` as given |
| `{{date}}` | the same instant, UTC, as `Sep 16, 2022` |
| `{{text}}` | `content.text`, escaped, as plain text (no `<br>`, no links) |
| `{{rating}}` | `rating`, the number as given (0–5) |
| `{{stars}}` | `rating` rounded: that many `★`, then `☆` up to five |

When a part has no data:

- **No image and no video.** If the card has a `.tbx-text`, drop the whole
  `.tbx-media` div. A photo-only card (no `.tbx-text`) keeps the `.tbx-media`
  div empty, with no `style`: it shows the network-name tile.
- **`rating` is null.** Drop the `.tbx-stars` div.

Filled with the sample posts JSON, every template gives back exactly the
sample cards the preview file shows — that is the check that the injection
is right.

- **Where they disagree, the preview wins.** The *Look* and *Values* lines
  below describe the same theme in words; if a value there differs from the
  preview's `:root`, use the preview. The design spec maps each `--tbx-*` token, under **Themes** in
  section 2:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wallapi/taggbox.com-API-Docs/main/guides/widget-design-spec.md?v=2026-09-24c
- **Sliders:** the slider, carousel and rail previews carry one small
  `<script>` that scrolls the row by one view when an arrow is clicked. It is
  part of the design: copy it as it is, into `preview.html` and the server's
  page alike. It fetches nothing and reads no data — the posts are already in
  the HTML. That script is the only JavaScript a build carries; the row
  itself is CSS scroll-snap, so it still swipes if scripts are off.
- Review themes are for review posts (a `rating` 0–5).
- One theme is the whole skin: no dark mode, no toggle, no second theme.

## The themes

For the build only — the details the build copies. Never show these
sections, or a summary or table of them, to the user when asking which theme.

  two thirds of the width, and two small square tiles stacked beside it. The
  next block mirrors it (big tile on the right). On hover a tile darkens and
  shows the network icon and a "View post" outlined button. Tiles touch.

  filled with a soft pastel gradient — yellow, green, blue, orange, pink,
  cycling card by card — holding the author row (avatar, name, network icon
  right) and the post text. Text-only posts are all panel.
- **Values:** page `#ffffff` · card `#fafafa` · text `#1f1b1b` · author
